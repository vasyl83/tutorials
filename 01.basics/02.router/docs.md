Currently my setup consists of MikroTik RB2011UiAS-2HnD-IN and two SG 200-08 8-Port Gigabit Smart Switches everything else is either connected directly to one of them or virtualized. If you don't touch SG 200-08 configuration at all they act as dumb switches and for now it is all I need them to do. Later VLAN isolation will be used.
