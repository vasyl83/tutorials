There are lots of good choices of OS for NASes. I am partial to Debian and will be using it as OS of choice throughout this guide, but here are some of the alternatives:

|Name|Description|
|----|----|
|[FreeNAS](http://www.freenas.org/)|FreeBSD based OS designed especially for NAS with zfs as file system of choice|
|[XPEnology](http://xpenology.com/forum/)|Opensource clone of Synology DSM|
|[UrRaid](https://lime-technology.com/)|Proprietary Linux based distro|
|[Windows Server 2012R2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/server-cloud/products/windows-server-2012-r2/overview.aspx)|Windows, any version actually|
