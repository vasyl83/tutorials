Docker is convenient way to run applications in containers separate from your host OS. Docker is not a replacement for virtual machines or all local applications, but it can help modularize your system and keep your host OS neat and tidy. Running apps in containers keeps things like the Mono libraries, Ruby dependences (and gems), Java, etc. from being stored on host OS. It make porting these containers to a new system and backups very easy.

####Installation
Simply follow [the official docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/debian/)

####Configuration
Create a new user for Docker (it is not strictly necessary, but it is cleaner this way and limits who can access container files saved outside the container, it is also possible your actual user) `adduser --system  --gecos "Docker User for containers" --disabled-password --group --home /opt/docker docker`. This command will not only create the user but will create a home folder for it directly under /. Now whenever you --create or --run a container you can centralise all the external data in one folder. 

If it is the first system user created on Debian it should have UID 108 and GID 113. Check UID and GID with:
```
Â» id docker
uid=108(docker) gid=113(docker) groups=113(docker)
```
Now all is left is to start the containers with the apps we want. The individual apps will be covered in [HTPC Software](../htpc), [Remote backup](../backup/remote) and in [Chapter 4](../../../webserver).
